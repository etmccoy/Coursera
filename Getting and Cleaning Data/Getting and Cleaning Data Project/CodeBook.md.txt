Script Guide:

First it reads in all the data necessary; X_train.txt, X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, subject_train.txt, features.txt and activity_table.txt.

It then merges the X train/test data and Y train/test data with rbind.

It then finds the mean and std columns in the X data and separates those out as they are the ones we are interested in.

Once that's done, it adds Activity and Subject columns to the data frame based on the Subject and Y data sets and splits the data based on these 2 factors.

Lastly it creates a new data table with the column means for each data type for each subject/activity combination and prints them to .csv

Tidy_Data.csv guide:

Reading through Tidy_Data.csv is easy enough. The second column displays the observation type based on Activity and Subject Number then displays the average means and stds along the row.
